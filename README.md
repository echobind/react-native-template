## Setup

1. Initialize a new react-native app: `react-native init MyApp --template=https://github.com/echobind/react-native-template-echobind`
2. Install Ruby and a version manager (like RVM or rbenv) if you don't already have them on your machine:

   Ruby: `$ brew install ruby`

   For RVM: `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`

   For rbenv: `brew install rbenv` ... and then setup your shell: `rbenv init`.

   Close your terminal and open a new one.

3. Install GraphicsMagick `brew install graphicsmagick`.
4. Run `bundle install`.
5. Run the setup script: `node ./setup`. A successful setup will give you the green light: `‚úÖ Setup completed!`.
