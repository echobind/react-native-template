## Quickstart

```shell
# with npx
npx react-native init MyApp --template=https://github.com/echobind/react-native-template-echobind

# with yarn & the react-native cli
yarn global add react-native-cli
react-native init MyApp --template=https://github.com/echobind/react-native-template-echobind
```

## About The Project

Here at Echobind, we value developer productivity. After having built lots of React Native projects, we decided to put together our own template to speed up development. Our template includes the following:

üèÜ Dev Productivity:

- [Hygen](http://www.hygen.io/) templates to easily generate components, screens, and utils with tests and stories.
- vscode settings for common overrides (üé® Colors, formatOnSave and rulers width that matches prettier)
- default Fastlane scripts for icon generation
- global styles and colors
- `react-navigation` preconfigured with a common setup
- Pre-configured scripts in `package.json` to start the app & deal with simulators
- Setup `lint-staged` to run eslint checks on `precommit`
- Setup the app for TypeScript

We hope it saves you as much time as it saves us! üëç

### Built With

- [React Native `0.61.1`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [`react-navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [Storybook 4](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [`@emotion/native`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/tree/master/packages/native) for styling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

While not required, we recommend using a version manager for Ruby and Node. Some popular version managers are:

** Ruby **

- (chruby)[https://github.com/postmodern/chruby]
- (rbenv)[https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv]

** Node **

- [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Follow the install docs for the version manager of your choice.

During the setup proceess, we will automatically check the versions on your machine and prompt you to install anything you're missing.

### Usage

In order to use this template, follow these steps:

1. Initialize a new react-native app: `react-native init MyApp --template=https://github.com/echobind/react-native-template-echobind`
2. Change directories into your new app: `cd MyApp`
3. Run the setup script: `node ./setup`. A successful setup will give you the green light: `‚úÖ Setup completed!`

During the setup process we will do the following:

- Setup a display name for your app
- Setup a bundle identifier (ex: com.myapp.mobile)
- Use [Solidarity](https://github.com/infinitered/solidarity) to ensure your environment has all expected dependencies installed
- Run `bundle install` and `pod install` so you don't have to
- Setup placeholder icon and a splash screen

## CI / Deployment:

In order to set up CI/Deployment, we've created custom hygen templates to save you time. These live in our [`hygen-templates-echobind` repository](https://github.com/echobind/hygen-echobind-templates). You'll find installation instructions, which will allow you to set up the following:

- CircleCI preconfigured for React Native. Fast build times!
- Fastlane lanes for alpha, beta, and production releases. These should be run on CI only!
- AppCenter integration for easy alpha distribution

For more info, please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/echobind/hygen-echobind-templates) in that repo.

## Docs

- [Customize Generator Templates](./docs/hygen-templates.md)
- [Navigation](./docs/navigation.md)
- [Splash Screens](./docs/splashscreens.md)
- [Setup CircleCI](./docs/circle-ci.md)
